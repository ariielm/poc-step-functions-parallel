Okay, I want to create a Proof of Concept (POC) of this solution with AWS Step Functions. I want to create a Step Function that will receive a list of SSN numbers. For each SSN number I want to make parallel HTTP GET requests to the URL: https://pocarielstepfunctions.free.beeceptor.com/ssn/ appending the corresponding SSN number on the end of the URL as a Path Parameter. Once all the HTTP GETs are finished I return success to the Step Function client. Can you do that for me?

## AI:

Yes, I can help you create a Step Function that meets those requirements! Here's an example Step Functions state machine definition that should achieve what you described:

```json
{
  "StartAt": "ParallelGetRequests",
  "States": {
    "ParallelGetRequests": {
      "Type": "Parallel",
      "InputPath": "$.ssnList",
      "OutputPath": "$.parallelResults",
      "ResultPath": "$.result",
      "Parameters": {
        "url": "https://pocarielstepfunctions.free.beeceptor.com/ssn/"
      },
      "Iterator": {
        "StartAt": "GetRequest",
        "States": {
          "GetRequest": {
            "Type": "Task",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:states:::states:startExecution.sync",
            "Parameters": {
              "StateMachineArn": "arn:aws:states:us-east-1:123456789012:stateMachine:GetRequest",
              "Input": {
                "ssn.$": "$",
                "url.$": "$$.Parameters.url"
              }
            },
            "End": true
          }
        }
      },
      "End": true
    }
  }
}
```

In this state machine definition, the ParallelGetRequests state represents the parallel execution of the HTTP GET requests. The input to this state is assumed to be an array of SSN numbers, passed in as the ssnList field in the state machine input. The url parameter is a constant that specifies the base URL for the HTTP requests.

The Iterator field defines a state machine that is executed once for each item in the input array. In this case, the state machine definition for the Iterator field simply calls another state machine (GetRequest) and passes in the current SSN number as input, along with the base URL for the HTTP request.

The ResultPath field specifies where the output of the state machine execution should be stored. In this case, the result will be an array of objects, one for each SSN number in the input array, where each object contains the output of the corresponding GetRequest state machine execution.

To use this state machine, you'll need to create the GetRequest state machine separately, and replace the StateMachineArn in the GetRequest state machine definition with the ARN of your GetRequest state machine.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.

Okay, but instead of making the HTTP GET Request directly from the AWS Step Function, I want to invoke a Lambda that will do the HTTP GET Request for me. Show me how the Step Function code will be now

## AI: 

Sure, here's an updated version of the Step Function state machine that invokes a Lambda function to perform the HTTP GET requests:

```json
{
  "StartAt": "ParallelGetRequests",
  "States": {
    "ParallelGetRequests": {
      "Type": "Parallel",
      "InputPath": "$.ssnList",
      "OutputPath": "$.parallelResults",
      "ResultPath": "$.result",
      "Parameters": {
        "FunctionName": "your-get-request-lambda-function-name",
        "Payload.$": "$$.Map.Item.Value"
      },
      "Iterator": {
        "StartAt": "InvokeLambda",
        "States": {
          "InvokeLambda": {
            "Type": "Task",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:states:::lambda:invoke.waitForTaskToken",
            "Parameters": {
              "FunctionName.$": "$.FunctionName",
              "Payload.$": "$.Payload",
              "TaskToken.$": "$$.Task.Token"
            },
            "End": true
          }
        }
      },
      "End": true
    }
  }
}
```

In this version of the state machine, the ParallelGetRequests state is still a parallel state that will invoke the Lambda function once for each SSN number in the input array. The Iterator field is also the same as before, with the InvokeLambda state machine definition being executed once for each item in the input array.

The main difference is in the Parameters field of the ParallelGetRequests state. Instead of specifying a url parameter, we're now specifying a FunctionName parameter, which is the name of the Lambda function that will be invoked for each SSN number in the input array. We're also passing the SSN number itself as the Payload parameter, so that the Lambda function knows which SSN number to retrieve.

In the InvokeLambda state machine definition, we're using the arn:aws:states:::lambda:invoke.waitForTaskToken resource to invoke the Lambda function and wait for it to complete before moving on to the next SSN number. We're also passing the TaskToken field as a parameter to the Lambda function, which allows the Lambda function to signal the Step Function when it has completed its work for that SSN number.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.

## Ariel:

But on this case, are we making all the HTTP GET Requests parallelized?

## AI:

Yes, that's correct! In this version of the Step Function state machine, all of the HTTP GET requests are performed in parallel.

Each SSN number in the input array is passed as a separate payload to the Lambda function, which then performs an HTTP GET request with that SSN number. Because the ParallelGetRequests state is a parallel state, the Step Function will execute multiple instances of the InvokeLambda state machine definition in parallel, with each instance processing a different SSN number.

Once all of the InvokeLambda instances have completed (i.e., all of the HTTP GET requests have finished), the Step Function will return the results in the parallelResults field of the output. The ResultPath field in the ParallelGetRequests state machine definition is used to specify where to store the results of the parallel execution.

## Ariel:

Okay, that's perfect. Now can you show me how the code of the AWS Lambda would be using Python as the programming language?

## AI:

Sure, here is an example implementation of the Lambda function in Python:

```python
import json
import requests

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    ssn = event["ssn"]
    url = f"https://pocarielstepfunctions.free.beeceptor.com/ssn/{ssn}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        result = response.json()
        return {
            "statusCode": 200,
            "body": result
        }
    else:
        return {
            "statusCode": response.status_code,
            "body": response.text
        }
```

In this implementation, the Lambda function receives an event object containing the SSN number to retrieve. The function constructs the URL with the provided SSN number and performs an HTTP GET request using the requests library. If the response status code is 200, the function returns the response body in the output. Otherwise, it returns the error information. Note that this implementation assumes that the response from the external API is in JSON format.

You would need to package this code as a Lambda function and grant it permission to make HTTP requests by configuring its execution role.
